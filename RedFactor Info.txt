Jumping, moving etc all on one script. Need some public variables for health, speed etc. Cylinder prefab.
Individual script for every weapon.
Each prefab should have a lot of scripts attached to it.

When instantiate object, create camera, position it on the gameobject

When players in air (i.e. jumping or blown or ground), their movements using w,a,s,d should be restricted, 1/3 of normal?
But then how is moving forward and jumping (holding down w and jump), w stays normal? but then w hold down jump turn back w hold down equals original place.
